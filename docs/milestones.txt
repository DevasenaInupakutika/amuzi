how to use the links between music and tracks?

will people understand that they are voting on the sound quality and not the music itself? r: by the first time the user press the vote button it shows a popup saying its purpose.


About feature 2, it can be so that music and youtube videos have different layouts (like border share and/or color). same comment about feature 3.

About item 4. IncBoard will handle music and albuns only (not youtube videos directly). But, for the first version, incBoard can be done with music objects only.

TODO: include on the documentation, the definicion of the objects "youtube video", "music" and "album".

The algorithm of the 2.2 is when it searches on youtube, it also searches for similar music on last.fm, and afterwards on youtube again.
