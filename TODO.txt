====================
This document contains which tasks remains to be done.
====================

1. Transform the list into a table with the following fields:
    image
    title
    duration (this is just desirable)
    the embedded youtube video
    listen option
    download mp3 option

2. Improve layout: Get something good looking. I don't want to spend much time
which this, it must be just a matter of browse around some template and
implement it.
